# Unifi

Provides an Ubuntu Server 16.04 LTS machine with the [Ubiquiti Unifi
Controller](https://www.ubnt.com/download/unifi/) installed. This is convenient
for home use where you don't need the controller running all the time, but
occasionally need to configure or upgrade access points.

The web interface is made available at https://10.1.10.55:8443/
